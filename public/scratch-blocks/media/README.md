# Scratch Blocks Media Directory

This directory contains media files needed for the Scratch Blocks interface.

The Scratch Blocks component will look for media files in this directory to render the block-based programming interface properly.

If you're experiencing issues with missing icons or graphics in the Scratch editor, you may need to copy the media files from the scratch-blocks package.
