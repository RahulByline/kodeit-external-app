The issue is that the conditional rendering structure in G4G7Dashboard.tsx is incomplete. 

The conditional rendering starts at line 1575:
{currentPage === 'course-detail' ? (
  // course detail content
) : currentPage === 'section-view' ? (
  // section view content  
) : (
  // dashboard content
)}  // <-- This closing is missing

The build error shows that the `)}` at line 1994 is not properly closing the conditional rendering because the entire conditional is missing its closing `)}`.

To fix this, we need to add the missing closing `)}` for the entire conditional statement right after the dashboard content ends.
