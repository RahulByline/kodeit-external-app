# 🎓 Grade-Based Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that students from different grade levels see appropriate dashboard content based on their grade level. Specifically, G1-G3 students get a simplified, age-appropriate dashboard while G4-G7 and G8+ students see progressively more complex content.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Grade Detection
- **Automatic Grade Detection**: Extracts grade from cohort names or usernames
- **Multiple Patterns**: Supports various naming conventions (Grade 1, G1, user1, student1, etc.)
- **Fallback Logic**: Defaults to G8+ if grade cannot be determined

### Dashboard Types
1. **G1_G3 (Early Elementary)**: Simplified, visual, interactive content
2. **G4_G7 (Upper Elementary)**: Intermediate content with some complexity
3. **G8_PLUS (High School)**: Full access to all features and content

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Grade Detection Logic
```typescript
// Enhanced grade extraction from cohort names or usernames
const extractGradeFromCohortName = (cohortName: string): number | null => {
  const patterns = [
    /grade\s*(\d+)/i,
    /g(\d+)/i,
    /user(\d+)/i,
    /student(\d+)/i,
    /(\d+)/i // Fallback pattern
  ];
  // Returns grade number (1-12) or null
};
```

### Content Filtering
```typescript
// Filter content based on dashboard type
const filterContentByGrade = (content: any[], contentType: string) => {
  switch (dashboardType) {
    case 'G1_G3':
      // Filter out advanced keywords
      return content.filter(item => !hasAdvancedContent(item));
    case 'G4_G7':
      // Filter out very advanced content
      return content.filter(item => !hasVeryAdvancedContent(item));
    case 'G8_PLUS':
      // Show all content
      return content;
  }
};
```

### Advanced Content Keywords (Filtered for G1-G3)
- advanced, complex, programming, coding, algorithm
- database, api, framework, debugging, optimization

## 🎨 Dashboard Features by Grade

### G1-G3 Dashboard
- ✅ **Simplified Navigation**: Large buttons, clear icons
- ✅ **Visual Learning**: Picture-based content, animations
- ✅ **Basic Activities**: Simple assignments, games, stories
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars, achievements
- ✅ **Filtered Content**: No complex programming concepts
- ✅ **Grade Indicator**: Shows "Grade X" and "Early Elementary"

### G4-G7 Dashboard
- ✅ **Intermediate Navigation**: Standard interface
- ✅ **Mixed Content**: Visual and text-based materials
- ✅ **Programming Basics**: Introduction to coding concepts
- ✅ **Advanced Activities**: More complex assignments
- ✅ **Grade Indicator**: Shows "Grade X" and "Upper Elementary"

### G8+ Dashboard
- ✅ **Full Navigation**: Complete feature set
- ✅ **Advanced Content**: All programming concepts
- ✅ **Complex Activities**: Advanced assignments and projects
- ✅ **Professional Tools**: Full development environment
- ✅ **Grade Indicator**: Shows "Grade X" and "High School"

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Login**: Student logs in with username/password
2. **Grade Detection**: System extracts grade from cohort/username
3. **Dashboard Type**: Determines appropriate dashboard (G1_G3, G4_G7, G8_PLUS)
4. **Content Filtering**: Filters courses, activities, and assignments
5. **Rendering**: Displays grade-appropriate dashboard

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cases for G1-G3 Detection
```javascript
// These usernames/cohorts should trigger G1-G3 dashboard:
- "Grade 1", "Grade 2", "Grade 3"
- "G1", "G2", "G3"
- "user1", "user2", "user3"
- "student1", "student2", "student3"
```

### Manual Testing
1. Login with `user1`, `user2`, or `user3` credentials
2. Verify dashboard shows "Grade X" and "Early Elementary" indicators
3. Check that content is simplified and age-appropriate
4. Confirm no advanced programming concepts are visible

## 🚀 Usage

### For G1-G3 Students
- Login with appropriate credentials (user1, user2, user3)
- Dashboard automatically detects grade level
- Content is filtered for age-appropriate learning
- Visual indicators show grade and level

### For Administrators
- Monitor grade detection in browser console
- Check logs for "🎯 G1-G3 STUDENT DETECTED!" messages
- Verify content filtering is working correctly

## 🔍 Debugging

### Console Logs
- `🎓 Determining student grade and dashboard type...`
- `🎓 Grade extracted from cohort name: X`
- `🎯 G1-G3 STUDENT DETECTED!` (for G1-G3 students)
- `🎓 Dashboard type determined: { grade, dashboardType, isG1G3 }`

### Common Issues
1. **Grade not detected**: Check cohort naming conventions
2. **Wrong dashboard type**: Verify grade extraction logic
3. **Content not filtered**: Check filterContentByGrade function
4. **Loading issues**: Ensure gradeDetectionComplete state is set

## 📝 Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Grade Mapping**: Allow manual grade assignment
2. **Content Overrides**: Enable specific content for individual students
3. **Parent Dashboard**: Separate view for parents of G1-G3 students
4. **Progress Tracking**: Grade-specific achievement systems
5. **Accessibility**: Enhanced accessibility features for young learners
