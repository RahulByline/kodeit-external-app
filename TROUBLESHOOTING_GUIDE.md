## üìä What the Diagnostic Tests

The diagnostic will check these 8 critical areas:

1. **API Connection** - Can the app reach your Moodle server?
2. **Authentication** - Is your login token valid?
3. **Company Detection** - Can the app find your school/company?
4. **User Fetching** - Can the app get all users from Moodle?
5. **Course Fetching** - Can the app get all courses from Moodle?
6. **Enrollment Fetching** - Can the app get enrollment data?
7. **Role Detection** - Can the app detect user roles correctly?
8. **School Admin Data** - Can the app get company-specific data?

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: API Connection Failed

**Solutions**:
- Log out and log back in

## üîç Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: Basic API Connection
```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
const response = await fetch('https://kodeit.legatoserver.com/webservice/rest/server.php?wsfunction=core_webservice_get_site_info&wstoken=2eabaa23e0cf9a5442be25613c41abf5&moodlewsrestformat=json');
const data = await response.json();
console.log('API Response:', data);
```

### Test 2: Company Detection
```javascript
// In browser console:
const response = await fetch('https://kodeit.legatoserver.com/webservice/rest/server.php?wsfunction=block_iomad_company_admin_get_companies&criteria[0][key]=suspended&criteria[0][value]=0&wstoken=2eabaa23e0cf9a5442be25613c41abf5&moodlewsrestformat=json');
const data = await response.json();
console.log('Companies:', data);
```

### Test 3: User Fetching
```javascript
// In browser console:
const response = await fetch('https://kodeit.legatoserver.com/webservice/rest/server.php?wsfunction=core_user_get_users&wstoken=2eabaa23e0cf9a5442be25613c41abf5&moodlewsrestformat=json');
const data = await response.json();
console.log('Users:', data);
```

## üìã What to Report

When you run the diagnostic, please report:

1. **Success Rate**: What percentage of tests passed?
2. **Specific Issues**: What specific error messages appeared?
3. **Console Logs**: Any error messages in the browser console
4. **API Responses**: What data is being returned from the Moodle API

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fixes

### If Company Detection is Failing:
The app is looking for a company named "zaki_international_school". If your company has a different name:
1. Open `src/services/moodleApi.ts`
2. Find line ~2180 (look for "zaki_international_school")
3. Update the company name to match your actual company name

### If API Token is Wrong:
1. Open `src/services/moodleApi.ts`
2. Update line 4 with your correct API token
3. Restart the development server

### If Users Aren't Showing:
1. Check if users exist in your Moodle instance
2. Verify the users have the correct roles assigned
3. Ensure the users belong to the correct company

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Run the Full Diagnostic** and report the results
2. **Check the browser console** for any error messages
3. **Test the manual API calls** above
4. **Report specific issues** you find

The diagnostic tools will help us identify exactly what's not working and fix it systematically.
