# Scratch GUI Integration for KODEIT

This document provides comprehensive instructions for integrating the Scratch programming environment into your React application.

## Overview

The Scratch GUI integration provides a simplified but functional programming environment that allows students to:
- Create visual programs using block-based programming
- Control sprites on a canvas
- Save and load projects
- Learn programming concepts through interactive visual programming

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Visual Programming Interface**: Block-based programming with motion, looks, and control blocks
- **Interactive Canvas**: Real-time sprite movement and rotation
- **Project Management**: Save and load projects with localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Works within the student dashboard layout
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and loading states

### ðŸ”„ Simplified Implementation
Due to React version conflicts with the official Scratch GUI, we've implemented a custom solution that provides:
- Canvas-based sprite rendering
- Block-based programming interface
- Project saving/loading functionality
- Real-time sprite animation

## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ScratchEditor.tsx          # Main Scratch editor component
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/student/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Emulators.tsx              # Updated emulators page with Scratch integration
â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts                 # Updated Vite config for Scratch dependencies
```

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps scratch-vm scratch-blocks scratch-render scratch-audio scratch-storage
npm install --legacy-peer-deps redux react-redux immutable lodash
```

### 2. Update Vite Configuration
The `vite.config.ts` has been updated to handle Scratch dependencies:
- Optimized dependencies for Scratch libraries
- WebAssembly support
- Global definitions for compatibility

### 3. Route Configuration
The Scratch editor is accessible at `/dashboard/student/emulators` and integrates seamlessly with your existing React Router setup.

## Usage Instructions

### For Students
1. Navigate to the Student Dashboard
2. Click on "Emulators" in the sidebar
3. Click on "Scratch Emulator" card
4. Use the programming blocks to control the sprite:
   - **Motion Blocks**: Move and rotate the sprite
   - **Looks Blocks**: Display messages and effects
   - **Control Blocks**: Add timing and flow control
5. Click "Start" to run animations
6. Click "Save" to store your project

### For Developers
1. The `ScratchEditor` component is self-contained and reusable
2. Projects are saved to localStorage by default
3. The component accepts props for project loading and saving callbacks
4. Error handling and loading states are built-in

## Component API

### ScratchEditor Props
```typescript
interface ScratchEditorProps {
  projectId?: string;                    // Optional project ID to load
  onProjectSave?: (projectData: any) => void;  // Callback for project saves
}
```

### Example Usage
```typescript
import ScratchEditor from './components/ScratchEditor';

function MyComponent() {
  const handleProjectSave = (projectData) => {
    console.log('Project saved:', projectData);
    // Save to backend, localStorage, etc.
  };

  return (
    <ScratchEditor 
      onProjectSave={handleProjectSave}
      projectId="my-project-123"
    />
  );
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Canvas Rendering
- Uses HTML5 Canvas for sprite rendering
- Real-time updates based on sprite position and rotation
- Grid background for visual reference
- Bounds checking to keep sprites on screen

### State Management
- Local state for sprite position, rotation, and animation
- Project data structure for saving/loading
- Loading and error states for user feedback

### Block Programming
- Simplified block interface with clickable buttons
- Categorized blocks (Motion, Looks, Control)
- Real-time execution of block commands

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Full Scratch GUI Integration**: If React version compatibility is resolved
2. **More Block Types**: Add variables, operators, and sensing blocks
3. **Multiple Sprites**: Support for multiple sprites on stage
4. **Sound Integration**: Audio playback for projects
5. **Backend Integration**: Save projects to server instead of localStorage
6. **Project Sharing**: Allow students to share projects
7. **Tutorial System**: Built-in tutorials for programming concepts

### Advanced Features
1. **Custom Blocks**: Allow creation of custom programming blocks
2. **Project Templates**: Pre-built project templates for learning
3. **Assessment Integration**: Track student progress and completion
4. **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time collaboration features
5. **Export Options**: Export projects as images or videos

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Canvas Not Rendering**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure canvas element is properly mounted
   - Verify WebGL support in browser

2. **Blocks Not Responding**
   - Check event handlers are properly bound
   - Verify state updates are triggering re-renders
   - Check for JavaScript errors in console

3. **Project Save/Load Issues**
   - Verify localStorage is available
   - Check data structure compatibility
   - Ensure proper error handling

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by adding to browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('scratch-debug', 'true');
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Canvas Optimization**: Limit canvas redraws to necessary updates
2. **State Management**: Use React.memo for expensive components
3. **Memory Management**: Clean up event listeners and timers
4. **Bundle Size**: Consider code splitting for large Scratch libraries

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support
- **Mobile Browsers**: Limited support (touch interactions needed)

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
2. **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize project data before rendering
3. **LocalStorage Limits**: Handle localStorage quota exceeded errors
4. **File Upload**: Validate file types and sizes for project imports

## Contributing

When contributing to the Scratch integration:

1. Follow the existing code style and patterns
2. Add proper TypeScript types for new features
3. Include error handling for all new functionality
4. Test across different browsers and devices
5. Update this documentation for new features
