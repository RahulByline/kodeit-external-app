## Conclusion

All Community and Enrollments pages across all dashboards now provide comprehensive, real-time functionality with role-specific customizations. The implementation includes robust error handling, efficient data processing, and a modern, responsive user interface that enhances the overall user experience.

Each dashboard provides contextually relevant data:
- **Admin**: System-wide overview and management
- **School Admin**: School-specific analytics and oversight
- **Teacher**: Student engagement and course management
- **Student**: Personal progress and community interaction

All pages are fully integrated with the IOMAD Moodle API, providing live data while maintaining fallback capabilities for reliability. The auto-refresh functionality ensures data is always current, while the manual refresh option gives users control over when to update their view.

The implementation successfully replaces all placeholder "coming soon" content with fully functional, feature-rich pages that provide real value to users across all roles in the system.
